# JavaScript basics

***

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.

# What is JavaScript? 
> JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

* Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
* Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
* Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

> Note: The reason the instructions (above) place the `<script> `element near the bottom of the HTML file is that the browser reads code **in the order it appears in the file**. <br/>
> If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency. To learn more about alternative approaches, see Script loading strategies.
